# Changelog

All notable changes to the WinDimmer64 project are documented here.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-26

### New Features
* **Inactivity Timeout OLED Power Saver**: Added a system idle tracking feature using `GetLastInputInfo`. Displays fade smoothly to a chosen Idle Dim level (up to 100% black overlay) to prevent OLED burn-in during periods of inactivity. The screens wake up instantly upon mouse or keyboard movement, bypassing slow hardware sleep/wake cycles. Added a checkbox option to physically turn off monitors.
* **Smooth Fading Transitions**: Implemented hardware-accelerated exponential-decay fading transitions when launching, exiting, or toggling dimming overlays.
* **Warm Amber Eye-Saver Tint**: Added a blue-light filter option that replaces neutral black overlays with a soothing warm orange/amber tint spectrum `RGB(255, 130, 45)`.
* **Focused Active Screen Highlight (Focus Mode)**: Added active monitor cursor tracking. The monitor containing the active mouse cursor remains bright while inactive screens fade deeper (+25% offset) to reduce visual distractions.
* **System-Wide Keyboard Hotkeys**: Registered global shortcuts (`Ctrl + Alt + ArrowUp/ArrowDown/D`) to control screen brightness levels and active states from any game, app, or browser.
* **Modern Fluent Win32 UI Panel**: Implemented custom rounded display cards, interactive sliders, checkbox controls, and system tray minimization.

### Updates
* **Per-Monitor DPI v2 Support**: Upgraded window positioning logic to dynamically scale and fit displays with mixed DPI values (e.g. 100% and 150%) on multi-monitor setups.
* **Strict Compiler Compatibility**: Simplified display config friendly name query with direct numbering fallbacks and standard C++ compliant wide-stream file path string pointer handling (`.c_str()`), allowing seamless compilation across both Microsoft MSVC (`cl.exe`) and LLVM-MinGW (`clang++`).
* **Standalone Portability**: Engineered the codebase using pure Win32 and Direct2D to achieve a single standalone executable under **200 KB** with zero external DLL runtime dependencies.
